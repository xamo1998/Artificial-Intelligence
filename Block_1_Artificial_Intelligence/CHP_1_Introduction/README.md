# 1. Introduction
In this chapter we will see a quick introduction to AI like:
- What is AI?
- The foundations of AI
- The history of AI

## 1.1 What is AI?
In Figure 1.1 we see eight definitions of AI, laid out along two dimensions. The definitions on top are concerned with *thought processes and reasoning*, whereas the ones on the bottom address *behavior*. The definitions on the left measure success in terms of fidelity to *human* performance, whereas RATIONALITY the ones on the right measure against an *ideal* performance measure, called **rationality**.

### 1.1.1 Acting humanly: The Turing Test approach
The Turing test was created to provide a satisfactory operational definition of intelligence.

A computer passes the test if a human interrogator, after posing some questions, cannot tell whether the responses are from a machine or a computer. The computer would need to have the following capabilities:
- **Natural language processing** to enable it to communicate successfully in English or any other language.
- **Knowledge representation** to store what it knows or hears.
- **Automated reasoning** to use the stored information to answer questions and to draw new conclusions.
- **Machine learning** to adapt to new circumstances and to detect and extrapolate patters.

#### Total Turing Test
This test includes a video signal so that the interrogator can test the subject's perceptual abilities.

To pass the total Turing Test, the computer will need:
- **Computer vision** to perceive objects.
- **Robotics** to manipulate obects and move about.

### 1.1.2 Thinking humanly: The cognitive modeling approach
If we are going to say that a given program thinks like a human, we must have some way of determining how humans think. There are 3 ways to do this:
1. **Through introspection:** Trying to cath our own toughts as they go by.
2. **Through psychological experiments:** Observing a person in action.
3. **Through brain imaging:** Observing the brain in action.

### 1.1.3 Thinking rationally: The "laws of tought" aproach
The greek philosopher Aristotle was one of the first to attempt to codify "right thinking". His **syllogism** provided patters for argument structures that always yielded correct conclusions when given correct premises: "*Socrates is a man; all men are mortal; therefore, Socrates is mortal*"

These laws of tought were supposed to govern the operation of the mind; their study initiated th field called **logic**.

There are 2 main obstacles to this approach:
1. It is not easy to take informal knowledge and state it in the formal terms required by logical notation.
2. There is a big difference between solving a problem "in principle" and solving it in practice.

### 1.1.4 Acting rationally: The rational agent Approach
An **agent** is just something that acts. All computers programs do something but the agents are supposed to do more like:
- Operate autonomously
- Perceive their enviroment
- Persist over a prolonged time period
- Adapt to change
- Create and pursue goals

A **rational agent** is one that acts so as to achive the best outcome.

## 1.2 The foundations of Artificial Intelligence

### 1.2.5 Psychology
### 1.2.6 Computer engineering
### 1.2.7 Control theory and cybernetics
### 1.2.8 Linguistics

## 1.3 The History of Artificial Intelligence
